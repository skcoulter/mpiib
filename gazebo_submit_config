# Test suite config file for submitting jobs/tests
# ====================================
#
# Comments, ignore lines that begin with a pound sign (#)
# The following is the format of the test selection lines in this file:
#
   # required fields:
   #   name (test name) :: Matches directory name of test or job. MUST NOT contain a double
   #                       underline "__" nor a period "."
   #   pes              :: Number of cpu's or cores needed
   #   nodes            :: Number of nodes needed
   #   tl (time_limit)  :: hh:mm:ss or an integer value of seconds to set the run time limit
   #

   # optional fields:
   #   nl (node_list)   :: quoted, comma-delimited list of nodes. Default is let Moab select nodes.
   #                       Otherwise, use a "-" to target nodes based on least used algorithm,
   #                       called tiling across nodes.
   #                       Must target nodes within the segment ("-u" parameter) selected.
   #   perc (percent)   :: integer indicating percentage of time to run this test relative to
   #                       other tests listed. The algorithm simply adds up the time_limit of each
   #                       test line, normalizes all the perspective runs times, then submits multiple
   #                       instances of eachtest accordingly.  This works best when applied
   #                       to only one test line as it does not factor in perc for other test cases.
   #   exec             :: test executable. Overrides CMD variable in test specific config
   #                       file (gzconfig) with this executable to call.
   #   pl (test param list):: quoted string. set to TEST_PARAMS ENV variable which overrides test
   #                       specific setting in config file (gzconfig).
   #   margs (msub args) :: arbitrary quoted string added on to msub call
